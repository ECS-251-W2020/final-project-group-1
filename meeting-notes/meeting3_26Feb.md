## Sam's comments:
       implement a cache replacement algorithm in the kernel.


## How did the last week go?

       Jayneel:
              Building from a system call to a kernel module for the previous system call.
              Accusim Download still not accepted unable to look at the simulator for a view into the functionality of the module.
              Left to run the LRU from the kernel, building a kernel module to call LRU code.
              
              

       Dhruvatara:
              made changes to strace source code to get data required by our system.
              started on a kernel module to remove a page from the page cache.


       Anusha: worked on implementing the Least Recently Used Algorithm using hashmaps and doubly linked lists,
               following the tutorial "Implement An LRU Cache - The LRU Cache Eviction Policy".

## What's next?

      Jayneel:
              finishing the kernel based LRU algorithm module,
              writing code for ARC.

      Dhruvatara:
              finish module to remove specific block from page cache
              make basic 2Q algorithm in C

      Anusha:implement the kernel buffer prefetching algorithm.

## Issues we faced?
      Dhruvatara:
              how to remove a specific block from page cache
      Jayneel: 
              SYSTEM CRASHED! three times.
              Accusim download still not provided; only way out is to base it totally on the paper.
