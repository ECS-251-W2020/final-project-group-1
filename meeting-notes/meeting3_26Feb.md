       Dhruvatara:
              made changes to strace source code to get data required by our system.
              started on a kernel module to remove a page from the page cache.

       Anusha: worked on implementing the Least Recently Used Algorithm using hashmaps and doubly linked lists,
               following the tutorial "Implement An LRU Cache - The LRU Cache Eviction Policy".

<<<<<<< HEAD

      Dhruvatara:
              finish module to remove specific block from page cache
              make basic 2Q algorithm in C

      Anusha:

## Issues we faced?
