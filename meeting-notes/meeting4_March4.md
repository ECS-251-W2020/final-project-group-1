## Sam's comments:
       Plan B- NBLoader


## How did the last week go?

       Jayneel:
              read on NBLoader, page cache data structures- felt lost after DT's revelation of a dead-end without even going deep into the project.
              
              

       Dhruvatara: 
             


       Anusha: read on Kernel hacking and watched some tutorials regarding NBLoader and Page Cache Data Structures. Updated the Global data structure and worked on testing this with various values of inodes, addresses and computation times.

## What's next?

      Jayneel: complete the page cache implementation so that we can run a NBLoader based prefetcher module for something say the readline function
             

      Dhruvatara:
             

      Anusha: complete the integration of LRU algorithm with algorithm module after understanding NBLoader.

## Issues we faced?
      ALL: PANIC!
