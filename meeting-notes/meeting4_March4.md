## Sam's comments:
       Plan B- LD-PRELOAD


## How did the last week go?

       Jayneel:
              read on LD-PRELOAD, page cache data structures- felt lost after DT's revelation of a dead-end without even going deep into the project.



       Dhruvatara:
              Read up on LD-PRELOAD, came up with an idea for a user mode implementation of prefetching and page replacement using LD-PRELOAD, wrote our application which is a C-program reading a large text file(>100MB) line by line.


       Anusha: read on Kernel hacking and watched some tutorials regarding LD-PRELOAD and Page Cache Data Structures. Updated the Global data structure and worked on testing this with various values of inodes, addresses and computation times.

## What's next?

      Jayneel: complete the page cache implementation so that we can run a LD-PRELOAD based prefetcher module for the fgets function


      Dhruvatara: implement a prefetching algorithm based on the prefetching methods of Linux kernel to prefetch page of the file into the page cache data structure.


      Anusha: complete the integration of LRU algorithm with algorithm module after understanding LD-PRELOAD.

## Issues we faced?
      ALL: PANIC!
