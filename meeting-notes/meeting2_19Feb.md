## How did the last week go?

       Jayneel: 
              started with a UI fuzzer, realised strace does the work on each individual command.
              worked on implementing a basic system call- "Hello! username", following a tutorial- Adding a Hello World System Call to Linux Kernel on a Ubuntu System.
       
       Dhruvatara: 
       
       Anusha: Implementating a system-wide open-file-table, associated file pointers and per-file information. 
       
## what's next?

      Jayneel:
              build accusim on a sys.
              understand how the manage module works in accusim.
              identify how the algorithms will run and send an input to the Manager Module about the block that needs to be added and removed.
