## Sam's comments:
       Plan B- NBLoader


## How did the last week go?

       Jayneel:
              read on NBLoader, page cache data structures- felt lost after DT's revelation of a dead-end without even going deep into the project.
              
              

       Dhruvatara:
             


       Anusha: 

## What's next?

      Jayneel: complete the page cache implementation so that we can run a NBLoader based prefetcher module for something say the readline function
             

      Dhruvatara:
             

      Anusha:implement the kernel buffer prefetching algorithm.

## Issues we faced?
      ALL: PANIC!
